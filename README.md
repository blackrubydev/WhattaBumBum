# WhattaBumBum

I'm glad you are interested in my github repository. This is my first attempt to program using the object oriented paradigm.

# What is this project all about?

This is a minecraft plugin project which allows your players to get illnesses, break their legs, injure their hands. 

# Is it complete?

No, it is still very much under development.

# Why are you posting it then?

I would like to get feedback on what I am doing right and what I am not. The main focus is on the project's object orientedness.
